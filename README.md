Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data

Data project for analyzing and visualizing trends in climate around the world. Creates graphs for visualizing yearly trend in average temperature per year. Can create graphs for countries, cities, or the entire world. 

Intended for use to visualize climate change and global warming. Currently working on data-scraping script for obtaining more recent data and create own dataset. Ways to improve the analysis would be to obtain data for Average High/Low Temperatures as climate change is better analyzed by looking at the extreme temperatures.
